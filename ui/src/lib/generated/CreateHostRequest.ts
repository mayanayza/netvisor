 * Request type for creating a host with its associated interfaces and ports.
 * Server assigns `host_id`, `network_id`, and `source` to all children.
 * Source is automatically set based on how the entity was created (API vs UI).
 *
 * Note: Services are created separately via `POST /api/services` after the host exists,
 * as service bindings require the real IDs of the interfaces/ports to reference.
